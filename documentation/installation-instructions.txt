1. Install the .NET 4.0 framework from http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851

2. Install Mono using the Windows Installer (includes GTK# and other dependencies) from http://www.mono-project.com/download/#download-win

3. Download the NuGet command-line utility from http://nuget.org/nuget.exe

4. Use NuGet to install the binaries for MonoGame:
	- Open a command line terminal
	- Navigate to the directory containing nuget.exe
	- Type 'nuget install MonoGame.Binaries -Version 3.2.0'
	- Wait for the installer to finish - it may look like it isn't doing anything for a minute

There will now be a new folder called MonoGame.Binaries.3.2.0 in the same folder as nuget.exe

5. Copy the contents of MonoGame.Binaries.3.2.0/build/net40 into the Chromaria project's lib folder (create this folder first if it does not already exist)

6. Open up Chromaria.sln using a C# IDE (I used Xamarin Studio, MonoDevelop and Visual Studio are also fine) and build the project

7. Copy the following files into the Debug folder:
	- blue-controller-cppn.xml*
	- blue-morphology-cppn.xml*
	- magenta-controller-cppn.xml*
	- magenta-morphology-cppn.xml*
	- chromaria-params.txt**
		* found in chromaria/cppns
		**  found in the main chromaria folder

8. Run the simulation, pressing 'o' to start.

Here are the implemented keyboard commands:
 p = pause
 o = unpause
 u = disable graphics
 I = re-enable graphics
