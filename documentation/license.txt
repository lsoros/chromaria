This package contains two main codebases: 1) a modified version of HyperSharpNEAT 2.1  and 2) the Chromaria simulator. 

HyperSharpNEAT (https://github.com/coastwise/HyperSharpNEAT), by David D'Ambrosio, is based on Colin Green's SharpNEAT (http://sharpneat.sourceforge.net/).  All original SharpNEAT code is covered by the original SharpNEAT license as described by Colin Green:

"The SharpNeat project consists of the core code packaged as SharpNeatLib and the main application simply called SharpNeat. SharpNeatLib is released under the Gnu Lesser General Public License (LGPL) which means you can link to it from your own programs, proprietory or otherwise. The SharpNeat application is released under the Gnu General Public License (GPL)."

As desctibed by David D'Ambrosio:

"HyperSharpNEAT modifies original SharpNEAT in the following ways to transform it into a HyperNEAT implementation:

-Updated several lists to .NET 2.0 generic versions.  This was done simply for efficiency, however Colin Green's original sorting and manipulation functions were kept as they were found to be more efficient
than built in versions.
-Added the ability have multiple activation functions in a single network.
-Removed the GUI and extra experiments.
-Added HyperNEAT specific classes
    -Substrate.cs: Defines the substrate on which neural networks are created. Should be inherited and implemented for specific experiments.
    -HyperNEATParmeters.cs: Reads parameters from a file that are specific to HyperNEAT.  Should be inherited and implemented for specific experiments.

The HyperNEAT additions are covered by the following license:

The Chromaria simulator is likewise covered under the same license.

We hope that this software will be a useful starting point for your own explorations in artificial life. The software is an alpha release and, as such, does not contain all of the features intended for the final release. If you want to be notified of future releases of the software or have questions, comments, bug reports or suggestions, send email to lsoros@eecs.ucf.edu.
